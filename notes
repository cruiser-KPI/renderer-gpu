TODOs:
+ loading camera, geometry, transforms from xml file
+ tiles for optix renderer
+ logging and stats
+ refactorings
+ scene file editing
+ add materials and path tracing
+ direct lightning
+ finish with environment textures
- blender plugin
- more lights and materials
- cleaning, easy gui managements
- saving rendered image to file
- obj material loading

Blender plugin goals:
- scene loading (geometry, camera, lights)
- easy material specification
- simple geometry and texture transfer

Blender plugin to-dos:
- research LuxCore and Mitsuba implementations of Blender plugins
    - how to render preview window
        - find out how to handle inter-process communication the easiest way with Python
        - how to refresh scene while process is running
- material preview window


+ loading only components that needs update (caching everything), deleting unnecessary
+ destroy all resources properly
+ make all pools singletons
+ texture pool and image cache
+ finish geometry pool
+ test all components with all possible inputs
- texture scale
+ single time start of renderer from Blender
+ proper default scene loading from Blender
- cycles material support
